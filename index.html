            Hello! My name is Ryan Mosely. I am from the San Francisco Bay Area and currently
            reside in the city of Los Angeles proper. My main goals for this course is to become
            a reliable developer for clients and to build skills to make projects of my own.
            <br>
            <br>
            My main hobbies include rock climbing, cooking, photography, and of course, coding.
            The rock gym I frequent is Cliffs of Id in Culver City; they provide great facilities
            for people interested in training for the sport. My favorite local outdoor spot 
            to climb is currenty out in Santa Barbara. The conditions in the central coast area
            are usually very ideal when it comes to being outdoors for hours at a time.
            When it comes to cooking, my favorite thing to cook currently is probably this 
            pasta and chickpea dish; it's a simple dish that is really savory and light. 
            My favorite style of photography is also pretty simple! I enjoy street photography;
            I love taking photos of small situations that we walk by everyday that we tend to 
            neglect.
